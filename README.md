# YT RSS Generator
A RSS link Generator for youtube channels from their handle URL.

**Purpose:** There are many annoying shady sites on internet which display countless ads or even ask for creation of account to generate a RSS feed url for any yt channel. Although it is easy to manually view the sourcecode of the youtube webpage and grab the `Channel Identifier` from there, a bash script does the job easily.

## Usage:


```
./YRG.sh https://youtube.com/@anyhandle
```
example:
```
rvs on orantium YRG on  main [?] 
❯ ./YRG.sh https://www.youtube.com/@RiveeksSmooth
Link with id: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtVv57nSoIPoqNXBB7WrsmA
RSS URL: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCtVv57nSoIPoqNXBB7WrsmA
```
